A hooded assassin character stands on a dock, facing the camera with a large, detailed ship in the background. The scene is set in a historical or pirate-themed environment. The video should simulate real gameplay with dynamic lighting and shadows, showing the character slightly moving, perhaps adjusting their stance or looking around. The ship's sails are partially unfurled, and the water gently ripples around it. The atmosphere should be immersive, with subtle animations like the character's cloak fluttering in the breeze and the ship's ropes swaying. The overall style should be reminiscent of an action-adventure game with a focus on exploration and stealth.
